## Getting Started

To get started, clone or download the repository to your local machine. Once downloaded, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start playing the game.

## How to Play

The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points, Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.

To start the game, click the "Start" button. The dealer and player each receive two cards. The player's cards are dealt face up, while the dealer's first card is dealt face down and the second card is dealt face up.

The player can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand) in order to try to get as close to 21 as possible. If the player's hand goes over 21, they "bust" and lose the game. Once the player stands, the dealer will draw cards until they reach a score of at least 17. If the dealer busts, the player wins. Otherwise, the player's score is compared to the dealer's score, and the highest score wins.
